## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional e-commerce auction web application, inspired by the popular platform eBay. This application allows users to:

- Create accounts and log in
- Search for items under auction
- Bid on and purchase items in forward auctions
- Directly purchase items in Dutch auctions

The project requirements are defined by six key use cases, as detailed in the Project Description document.

This project was co-led by myself and Pouya Sameni (https://github.com/Pouya-Sameni), with both of us working closely to ensure the successful delivery of the application.
